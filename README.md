### "Brutalism" design choice

Seem to be on brand... "Brutalism" in web design, "tends to be characterized by an extremely simplistic, almost minimalist approach to layout and UI design. Brutalism is a bold, counterintuitive take on raw, eye-catching visual designâ€”and can be difficult to pin down with a definition, since it essentially aims to defy definition"

### Hosting choices
