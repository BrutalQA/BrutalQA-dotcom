          <p>
            Denver based, I love M&M’s and all things outdoors. Also a passionate QA Automation Engineer with over a decade of hands-on experience, 
            known for building robust testing frameworks and elevating quality practices in everything from startups to Fortune 500 companies. I’ve 
            led projects that cut costs, sped up processes, and ensured high-quality products across web and mobile platforms. Skilled in JavaScript,
             WebDriverIO, Cypress, and Appium, I work closely with DevOps and engineering teams to integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines smoothly. 
             Along the way, I’ve had the chance to mentor junior engineers, establish best practices, and even contribute to a successful IPO.
